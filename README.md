# How do I play it?
You can find pre-built JARs on the [Releases page](https://github.com/Elenterius/Bio-Factory/releases), or jump directly to the latest version [here](https://github.com/Elenterius/Bio-Factory/releases/latest). Download either a slim or default jar, and drop it into your mods folder like any other mod. Keep in mind you need both [Biomancy](https://modrinth.com/mod/biomancy) and [Create](https://modrinth.com/mod/create) installed for Bio-Factory to work.
